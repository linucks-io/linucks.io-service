**linucks.io** is a web application where you can test out a high range of Linux distros before actually installing in on your system.
Linux is a popular operating system family which is used mainly by developers because of the many benefits. Since it is an operating system family, there
are many options to choose from which can be quite confusing for the user.

**linucks.io** is designed for this exact purpose. With this application, we try the user by simulating a virtual environment of the distro of the user's choice.
